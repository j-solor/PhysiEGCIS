libRoadRunner high performance and portable simulation engine for systems and synthetic biology.

libRoadRunner 1.0 supports the following features:

- Time Dependent Simulation (with optional conservation law reduction) using CVODE
- Supports SBML Level 2 to 3 but currently excludes algebraic rules and delay differential equations
- Uses latest libSBML distribution
- Defaults to LLVM code generation on the backend, resulting is very fast simulation times
- Optional generation of model C code and linking at run-time
- Add plugins, distribution comes with Levenberg-Marquardt optimizer plugin
- Compute steady state
- Metabolic Control Analysis
- Frequency Domain Analysis
- Access to:
  - Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
  - Jacobian, full and reduced
  - Structural Matrices of the stoichiometry matrix
